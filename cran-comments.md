  * - /R/tidyformula.R
* I have added a reference in standard form to /DESCRIPTION for methods contained in the file /R/expr_utils.R and changed the reference in the file /R/expr_utils.R to standard form
* I have added a return value to the documentation of the exported function tidyformula() defined in /R/tidformula.R
